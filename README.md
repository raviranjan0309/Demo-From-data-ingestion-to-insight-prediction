# Demo: From-data-ingestion-to-insight-prediction
This demo shows you how to ingest, transform, explore and train ML model on without writing a single line of code. In this tutorial you will do the following:   
  * Simplifying data migration and integration 
  * Accelerating time to insights 
  * Turning data into predictions
  
**Prerequesites**
 * Basic understaing of extraction, transformation and ingestion of data.
 * Basics of exploratory data analysis
 * Basics of supervised machine learning algorithms
 
**Limitations**
This is just a quick demo of end to end ML pipeline on structured dataset leveraging managed services of Google Cloud Platform.
